# friend_finder
friend matching app using a survey to find your best match

This app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from a users' survey answers, then compare these answers to answers from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
